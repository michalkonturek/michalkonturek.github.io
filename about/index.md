### Hello, I am Michal Konturek.

I am a software engineer interested in open-source and mobile development. I am currently living, together with my wife [Chen Chen][CC], in a very .NET-centric city called Nottingham. 

[CC]:https://github.com/chenkonturek

In my spare time I create awesome things with code, which (most of them) I open source on [GitHub][MK].
According to the [Open Source Report Card][OSCD], I am one of the 3% most active Objective-C users, [who loves pushing code][oscd-events].
